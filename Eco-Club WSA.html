The WSA Eco-Club has organised a Tree-Plantation Drive as a small step towards a brighter future. We will start small to achieve big, and follow with activities that will lead to a great change! We aim to get the <u> Green Flag </u> which is a flag that is given to schools worldwide to show that we are a sustainable school. Previously it was easy to get, but as the climate get's worse and pollution increases, they expect more from us, but together, we can do anything. And our goal is to obtain the <u> <font face= "calibri" color="DarkGreen" Size="8"> GREEN FLAG </u>
