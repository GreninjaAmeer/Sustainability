In the broadest sense, sustainability refers to the ability to maintain or support a process continuously over time. In business and policy contexts, sustainability seeks to prevent the depletion of natural or physical resources, so that they will remain available for the long term. Sustainability is the act of preserving our world for the future generations, this means providing care for our planet, and not harming it by releasing harmful substances. A sustainable world is a desire for all the people in the world, but everyone must strive to reach the common goal.
